# People Counter Automation
## Abstract:
        This project is an idea of counting the number of people who are entering and exiting the clasroom using sensors.According to the count and the strength of the classroom the electrical appliances are going to be automated using the microcontroller and the required circuits.The people count and the experiment validation results can be viewed through the display

## High Level Requirements:
        This project idea focuses on automation of the electrical appliances in a classroom.
        Conservation of electricity.
        According to the classroom strength electricity is to be used.

## Low Level Requirements:
        IR Sensor
        LCD Display
        Main Relay Board
        Arduino
        Power Supply
